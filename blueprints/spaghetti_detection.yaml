# Enhanced Bambu Lab Spaghetti Detection Blueprint
# Features: timeout, custom thresholds, warning notifications, disable action.
# Handles Obico API calls and uses YAML anchors for cleaner logic.
# Requires a manually created Home Assistant Input Datetime helper.

blueprint:
  name: Bambu Lab - Spaghetti Detection (Enhanced)
  description: |
    Bambu Lab - Spaghetti Detection with enhanced threshold control,
    warning notifications below failure threshold, and temporary disable via notification action.
    Requires Bambu Lab integration and Obico ML API setup.
    Requires a manually created Home Assistant Input Datetime helper (input_datetime).
